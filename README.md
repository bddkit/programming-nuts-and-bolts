# C#-programming-nuts-and-bolts

The purpose of this repository is to make programming easy for an individual who wants to be a **.NET (C#)** programmer/software developer/software engineer. This is especially for those who do not want to read a thick book (neither soft nor hard copy). The aim is to explain the concept by the code itself and comment.

The repository contains the following modules and one should start in the order it is listed to get the most out of it.
 
## 1GettingStarted

In this repository, the basic concept of C# programming is explained. The class names, method names, and comment sections have been used to describe the concept.
To learn the fundamentals of C# programming, you can download the repository and follow the comments in the code. The starting point is the *Program.cs* file. The files are listed below in an order you should navigate:

1.  **Program.cs** : The starting point of the tutorial. This is the place where all other files are tight together.
2.  **Variables.cs** : What is a variable? What are the different types of variables?
3.  **CommentInCode.cs** : Shows how to use the comment in C# to explain the code.
4.  **TypeCasting.cs** : What is typecasting? How many types of casting?
5.  **UserInput.cs** : How to get input from a user? In *Program.cs*, the section where this class has been called is commented out because it will not execute the rest of the program until you give all required input. If you want to execute this class and method, just uncomment and execute the program.
6.  **Operators.cs** : Demonstrates most basic Operators available in .NET(C#).
7.  **Maths.cs** : Shows the important methods in *Math* class  that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.
8.  **Strings.cs** : Shows the important methods in *string* class that allows you to perform various operations.
9.  **Booleans.cs** : What is boolean value and how to use it in expression?
10. **Conditions.cs** : Different types of conditions in C# and their usages.
11. **Loops.cs** : What is the loop in C#? How many types of loops and when to use them? How to break or continue a loop?
12. **Array.cs** : What is an array? How to create and use it?
